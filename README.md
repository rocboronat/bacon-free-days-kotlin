# bacon-free-days-kotlin
Know the last bacon day with this Kotlin-powered app

When I started this project, I thought it was going to be a quick and dirty way to meet Kotlin. But, after I realized than Kotlin was understanding every idea I had without knowing its syntax, I started building a nice app with zero boilerplate.

By the way, this app has been built on a great Schibsted’s Lab Day. A Lab Day is a free day to do whatever you want to improve yourself, your team and the company. And I’m trying Kotlin ‘cos I think that it will make me, my team and the company, faster and cleaner.

By the way… it’s a game changer. Let me try it a little more :·)
